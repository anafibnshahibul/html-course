  <p><!--The abbr tag in HTML marks up abbreviations or acronyms, providing 
    semantic meaning and improving accessibility by allowing the full form to be shown as a t
    ooltip when the user hovers over the shortened text, using the title attribute for the expansion 
    (e.g., <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr>). It's the standard way to define abbreviations 
    in HTML5, helping screen readers and search engines understand the text, 
    though it's often styled with a dotted underline by default. -->
